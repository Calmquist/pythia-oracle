####Changelog

Please note that this is very rough and just to give you an idea of what's been changed or improved. API breaking and save game breaking stuff may happen fairly frequently until we get up to 1.0!

If your save game breaks, read the error message; you'll usually be able to insert a missing variable into the config file (or rename a file if needed) manually. You can also make a fresh game and try copying your files into it.

As always, save backup copies of your text files as frequently as possible!
