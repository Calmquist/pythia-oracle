##### What is it?

Pythia is a tool for running solo adventures. It uses python and kivy and will probably run on any platform they will. I wrote it with two goals in mind; first, I wanted to be able to generate content on the fly for my multi-player sandbox campaign while keeping track of that content and second, I wanted to be able to run solo characters through adventures that would surprise me. There are many great GM emulating tools out there, software and print. With Pythia, you can use the built-in generators or your own pdfs or stuff you find on the web or wherever -- it doesn't tell you how to play, it just tries to help you do so.
