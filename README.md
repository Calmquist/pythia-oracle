#### Pythia-Oracle
Project page is [here](https://exposit.github.io/pythia-oracle/). My blog is [here](https://exposit.github.io/katamoiran/). Eventually I'll make a more detailed project page. Likely, anyway.

##### What is it?

Pythia is a framework to run solo adventures. It uses python and kivy and will probably run on any platform they will. I wrote it with two goals in mind; first, I wanted to be able to generate content on the fly for my multi-player sandbox campaign while keeping track of that content and second, I wanted to be able to run solo characters through adventures that would surprise me. There are many great GM emulating tools out there, software and print. This is what works for me.

##### Solo RPG Gaming! How does that even work?

The basic procedure I use is pick a system, make a character, fire this program up, and start asking questions. Type in a question like "Am I in a room?" and hit the "???" button. If the answer is yes, type in a room description. If no, maybe the hero is in a cave. Or a spaceship. Or in a forest. Ask again to find out!

... or don't. You can play however you want to! Pythia just seeks to facilitate that play. You can also use it to generate random content for a multi-player campaign.

##### How do I install this?

First, install python 2.7 (if you don't already have it). If you're on a Mac, I suggest using Homebrew. Then install Kivy. Now download or clone this repository, open up a terminal, go to the directory you just made, and type "python pythia.py". If you get an error message, read it and do what it says to do!

##### Wait, I want more tables!

I don't blame you. I use a ton more myself but I don't think it'd be cool to use other authors' content without asking. So I've started asking!

Until then, you have a couple of options; you can use the "pick one" buttons to get weighted answers from a copy-pasted table on the fly, or you can add in whatever tables you like in the code. I've included a sample as a guide. If the tables are created by you or you have permission from the original author and you want to share them, drop me a line and I'll add a link to them here (or put them in the repo).

Happy Solo Gaming!
